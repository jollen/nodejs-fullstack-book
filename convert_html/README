This folder is used to convert HTML files to Markdown and place them in your book.

To do this:

1) Place the HTML files in this folder
2) Go to the import page for your book (E.g. http://leanpub.com/yourbookname/import)
3) Click on the "Start Conversion" button.

We will take all files that end in .html, convert them to markdown and place them in your manuscript folder.

The HTML files will be placed in convert_done after they are converted.
